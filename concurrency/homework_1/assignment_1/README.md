# **Simple Fork and Exec**

*Objective:* Understand the creation of a child process using `fork` and how to replace it with a new program using `execl`.

*Write a program that:*
* Uses `fork` to create a child process.
* In the child process, use `execl` to run the `ls` command to list the contents of the current directory.
* The parent process should print "Parent process done" after the child process is created.

*Expected Output:* The directory listing should be printed, followed by the parent's message.
